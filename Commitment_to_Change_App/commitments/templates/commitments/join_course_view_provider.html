            This page will allow clinicians to confirm that they want to join
            your course <strong><em>{{ course.title }}</em></strong>. This confirmation
            is not shown to you because this account is not a clinician account and cannot
            enroll in the course as a student. You can distribute the link to this page and
            clinicians will be able to use it to enroll as students.
