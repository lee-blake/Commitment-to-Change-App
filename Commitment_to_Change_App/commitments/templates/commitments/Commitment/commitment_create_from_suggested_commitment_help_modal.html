  Commitments made by joining a suggested commitment must retain the same Title, Description, and Associated course

{% comment %} 
    Surrounding the extended template content (modal_everything) with these {% with %} statements 
    is necessary to allow the parent template to access our modal_id variable.
    Two with statements are necessary in order to first fetch and format the current 
    commitment_id, and then prepend our action string to create a unique modal_id for the modal to use.
