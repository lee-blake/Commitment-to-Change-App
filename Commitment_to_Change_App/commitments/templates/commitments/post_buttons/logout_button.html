<!-- The reason this is a form is that Django has deprecated logging out with GET requests. We therefore need to
submit a POST request to the logout URL via a form. -->
<form action="{% url 'logout' %}" id="logout-form" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <button type="submit" class="logout-button primary-accent">Log Out</button>
