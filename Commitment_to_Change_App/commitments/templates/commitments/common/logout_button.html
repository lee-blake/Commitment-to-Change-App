{% comment %} The reason this is a form is that Django has deprecated logging out with GET requests. We therefore need to
submit a POST request to the logout URL via a form. {% endcomment %}
<form action="{% url 'logout' %}" id="logout-form" method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  <button type="submit" class="standard-button primary-accent">Log Out</button>
</form>
