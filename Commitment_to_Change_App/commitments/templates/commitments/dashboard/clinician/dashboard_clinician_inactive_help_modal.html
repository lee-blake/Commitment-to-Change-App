Inactive Commitments are commitments that you have either completed, or have discontinued.
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Reopening a Commitment:</strong> If you have completed or discontinued a commitment by accident, or you wish to re-open it for any 
        other reason, you can do so by clicking the "Reopen" button. This will move your commitment to either the "In-progress" or "Past Due" section in
        the "Active Commitments" panel above, depending on the due date.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Viewing an inactive Commitment:</strong> To view an inactive commitment, click on the button below containing your commitment's name.
</ul>

{% comment %}
Surrounding the extended template content (modal_everything) with these {% with %} statements
is necessary to allow the parent template to access our modal_id variable.
Two with statements are necessary in order to first fetch and format the current
commitment_id, and then prepend our action string to create a unique modal_id for the modal to use.
